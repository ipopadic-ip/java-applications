## Java CRUD Applications
This repository contains two Java-based CRUD applications, each showcasing different approaches to software architecture. The first follows the traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, and the second utilizes a more abstracted design for greater flexibility and scalability. The third project features an MVC structure with interfaces, offering a clean and well-organized codebase.

## Projects:
# 1. MVC CRUD Application
This application follows the MVC architecture, with a clear separation between the Model, View, and Controller layers.

Ideal for projects requiring well-structured code with distinct responsibilities.

You can find this project in the mvc-crud-app folder.

# 2. Abstracted CRUD Application
This version uses a more abstracted approach, designed for flexibility and modularity.

It doesnâ€™t follow the MVC pattern strictly but instead focuses on reusability and extensibility.

You can find this project in the abstracted-crud-app folder.

# 3. MVC with Interfaces CRUD Web Application
This application follows the MVC structure, enhanced with interfaces to improve flexibility and maintainability. The use of interfaces allows for a more modular approach to handling business logic, making the code clean, easy to manage, and adaptable for future changes.

You can find this project in the SiMS-mvc-app folder.
